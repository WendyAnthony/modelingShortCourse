After the first run through a few things became apparent

The big one is that the day is basically one part GEE one part R

The GEE material is working pretty well

The R material is much more confusing in general
# Part 1
## Goals for improvement
1. 20 min introduction to GEE
  - incorperate existing training material if possible
  - potentially just show the GEE intro video
2. outline the day
3. show how to fetch the documents from git hub


# Part2
this is pretty much set
1. find the rmd documents
2. knit and push to the git hub

# Part 3
Content is good
1. collect a .shp to demo shapeexscape
2. get an html to demo generating a fusion table

# Part4
good to go

### Break

# create an introduction to R document

# Part 5
1. why are we using pacman? can we simplfy some of the packages being loaded?
2. also I think that some of this can be simplied and renamed to make it more readable
3. what does the ord imp = "SE"


# part 6
1. try to simplfy as much as possible
2. included the information about exporting to tif
